# Data Analysis Project 2

The current setup assumes an *env.py* file, which has your data structure in it but is ignored by git
so we don't get merge conflicts about path settings. 

Mine looks like this:

```
top_folder = "data/data/"

foggy_im_path = top_folder + "foggy"
clear_im_path = top_folder + "clear"
net_im_path = top_folder + "net"
```

Also, everything in the *data* folder is ignored so we don't push large files around.
